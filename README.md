CONCLUSION

The boxplot shows the variability of the size of the tumor for the last timepoint available. We can see a remarkable difference among all 4 drug regimen. Capomulin shows the lowest variability but this is due to there are only two data points. Ceftamin shows the second lower variability as well as a biased distribution to the right hand side

The mouse i557 had an abrupt decrease in the tumor volume when it was measuared in day 5, after this it started to grow up again at slower rate.

There is a positive strong linear relation between mice's weight and the tumor volume,that means the bigger the mouse the bigger the tumor, this is confirm with the correlation value of 0.84.The slope confirms that for each extra gram of weight, the tumor will increase in 0.95 mm3
